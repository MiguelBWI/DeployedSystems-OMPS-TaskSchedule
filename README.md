# DeployedSystems-OMPS-TaskSchedule
Task schedule generator creates, from a formatted text list of tasks requests (task schedule), a task request file 
that is ingestible by the mission management tool used by the mission planners.  Currently the mission planners manually
enter the tasks, up to 320 tasks for each schedule.
